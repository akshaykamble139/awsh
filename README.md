# AWSH – A Better Frontend for AWS

**AWSH (Amazon Web Services – Humanized)** is a browser-based web client that offers a simpler, faster, and more intuitive alternative to the official AWS Console. It runs entirely in the browser and interacts directly with AWS using the JavaScript SDK (v3). No backend or server required.

### 🚀 Features
- 🔐 Temporary AWS credentials input (stored only in memory)
- 📁 Full S3 bucket browser – upload, download, delete, create folders
- 🖥️ EC2 manager – view, start, stop, reboot, terminate instances
- 👤 IAM viewer (read-only)
- 🌍 Region selector and responsive UI
- ⚡ Fully static and hosted on GitHub Pages

### 🛠️ Built With
- React + TypeScript + Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- AWS SDK v3 (modular)
- GitHub Pages for hosting

### ⚠️ Disclaimer
This is an **unofficial** tool and has no affiliation with Amazon. Your AWS credentials are never sent to any server — all interactions happen client-side via the AWS SDK.
